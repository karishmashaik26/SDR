# 🛰️ Software Defined Radar (SDR) – MATLAB Simulink Project

This project focuses on the **design and simulation of a Software Defined Radar (SDR)** system using **MATLAB Simulink**, complete with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for real-time control and visualization. Developed as part of a 10-week internship at **Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering (MCEME), Secunderabad**, this work showcases the potential of reconfigurable radar systems in modern applications.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- **Radar Simulation** using Simulink including:
  - Transmitter & Receiver blocks
  - Free-space channel modeling
  - Target object and radar platform setup
  - Doppler and Range processing
- **GUI Implementation** in MATLAB for:
  - Parameter selection (e.g., frequency)
  - Range-Doppler maps
  - CFAR target detection visualization
  - 3D spatial positioning of detected targets
- **Multi-Frequency Analysis** from **1 GHz to 20 GHz** to evaluate performance variation across frequencies.
- **Advanced Signal Processing**: Non-coherent integration, beamforming, time-varying gain (TVG), FFT-based Doppler shift detection.
- **Utility** in domains such as:
  - Defence & Surveillance
  - Automotive ADAS systems
  - Aerospace monitoring
  - Remote sensing and environmental scanning
  - Educational radar experimentation

## Technologies Used

- MATLAB & Simulink
- Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) via App Designer
- Radar Range-Doppler Analysis
- CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) detection

## 📈 Results & Observations

- High-resolution detection at **higher frequencies (10–20 GHz)** with trade-offs in signal stability and false alarms.
- **1 GHz and 3 GHz** offered better SNR stability and lower false alarm rates but at reduced resolution.
- GUI-based analysis helps visualize **target range, velocity, and spatial orientation**.
- Maximum radar range tested: **18 km**.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Integration of **AI/ML** for intelligent target classification.
- Cognitive radar capabilities with environment-adaptive reconfiguration.
- Support for **mmWave/5G radar**, **edge computing**, and **real-time embedded processing** on FPGA/GPU.
- Augmented Reality (AR)-based radar visualization systems.
